    The header and footer are fixed to allow the site wrapper to scroll under them, more like a card interface from google material design
    Box shadows added but need tweaking to get the right level to them
    Media Queries work correctly with nav and the site wrapper to still produce the card layout, needed to add in padding to correctly work like its a desktop styling
    Nav now also links to everypage
